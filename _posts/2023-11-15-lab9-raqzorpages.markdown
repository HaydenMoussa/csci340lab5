##Finishing the Tutorial

The tutorial took longer than expected but the outcome seems very well rounded to me and I have a way better understanding of how razor pages works now then I did prior to this lab. Some struggles I had were getting the create button to work on the site and getting the index.cshtml from pages/details to read the utilities file. But in the end I was able to figure those issues out. Click [Here](https://github.com/HaydenMoussa/csci340lab9) to access my repository for this lab.
