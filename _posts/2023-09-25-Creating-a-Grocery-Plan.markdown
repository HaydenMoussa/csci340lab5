## Helping a Local Grocey Store

Today I sketched out how information might flow through the app. I created some diagrams to help show how that might happen. Some assumptions I made are that the customers will have phones, addresses, and emails. I also assumed that the store is capable of storing their inventory on the website. I am satisfied with how my drawings came out. I think with some more practice and some more guidance these will become a very helpful tool in the future.
