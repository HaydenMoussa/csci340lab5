## Trials and Tribulations 

Nothing for me was super easy, I spent a lot of time debugging and trying to get my pages to run. I was confused about where to run the code given in the tutorial, wether that was the terminal is VSC or ina comand prompt. I had trouble translating the name of my new database "Shark", every time the word "Movie" was used I had to replace it with Shark. Razor pages and Jekyll were similar in how they both have shared layouts. That each post, model, home, or about page will use. With the tutorial to help I think I could make another razor application. Click [Here](https://github.com/HaydenMoussa/csci340lab8/tree/main) to access my repository with the razor page.
