## I Made That Way Harder Than It Should Have Been

Basically everything we have been doing in these labs have been new to me. I have been enjoying the learning curve through. Lots of new programs, languages, and ways of going about coding. I am enjoying seeing how the web is actually created. I definitly struggled getting my server to work, I spent a lot of time looking at [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) with little success. But in the end after a little messing around I got everything to work. [Here](https://haydenmoussa.github.io/csci340lab1/) is a cool link to my noun website.
