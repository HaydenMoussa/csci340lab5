## I Don't Know what I Just Did

Some of the hard thing I struggled with,
1. Getting the bundle command to work
2. Getting my local server running
3. Currently having problems getting config to work

I used some websites to help me like [Config Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet#:~:text=Extended%20Syntax%20%20%20%20Element%20%20,sentence%20with%20a%20footnote.%207%20more%20rows%20) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) both came in handing when making this first progect.
