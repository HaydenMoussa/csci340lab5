## SW Reflection ##

<p> The skill I most valued when working with our community partner was communicating and listening. It was very necessary when working on our project to 
keep in constant communication with our community members and keep them up to date on what we were working on. With that comes listening to the comments and concerns they have about our project and changing our project to match that. I think these skills match well with my talents, I came into this project knowing that I didn't know very much. So I spent the first half of the project listening and when work started I felt like I kept good communication throughout the semester with my groupmates. Through this project, I have grown in both of these skills. This project focuses on making the job of caring for the youth in our community easier, especially the less privileged. 
Our partner works with keeping the county updated on what is happening in our juvenile court system. Their job is very important because it keeps the youth in our community safe. Without them, the most vulnerable in our community could be taken advantage of by the courts and our police system. They help to show us what systems are working in our court system. My social belief that coding and computer science in general can bring very meaningful change to a community was confirmed through this project. This project has reshaped my views on all the good computer science can bring, and has opened my horizons to what a job or career in computer science might look like. This project has brought my attention to the juvenile court system and its impact on my volunteering and actions in the future. </p>
