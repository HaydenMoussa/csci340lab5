## The Website

My group has made great progress on the website so far. Most of the work done so far has been getting razor pages set up along with, creating the proper tables in the database, seeding the database, and creating a login. Most of this work has come from my other group members as those were the tasks they decided on at the begining of the project. I will now begin formatting the front page and converting the data in the database into something that is that looks more like the past Faulkner County Juvnile Reviews.

##Second Meeting

Our client was very please by our progress so far on the project. She did not have any questions or comments about what we had so far. We asked her some clarification questions about the data base and the current data she had. She was able to anwser them.
